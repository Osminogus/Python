# MASTER YODA: Given a sentence, return a sentence with the words reversed
# master_yoda('I am home') --> 'home am I'
# master_yoda('We are ready') --> 'ready are We'
# Note: The .join() method may be useful here. The .join() method allows you to join together strings in a list with some connector string. For example, some uses of the .join() method:
#
# >>> "--".join(['a','b','c'])
# >>> 'a--b--c'
# This means if you had a list of words you wanted to turn back into a sentence, you could just join them with a single space string:
#
# >>> " ".join(['Hello','world'])
# >>> "Hello world"

def master_yoda(text):
    my_list = text.split()
    my_list.reverse()
    result = " ".join(my_list)
    return result


# Check
print(master_yoda('I am home'))

# Check
print(master_yoda('We are ready'))
